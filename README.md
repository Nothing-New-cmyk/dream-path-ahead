## Technical Documentation

Modern React application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, next-themes dark mode, advanced animations, SEO optimization, PWA features, and responsive design for optimal performance.

## Light/Dark Mode Implementation

The application uses `next-themes` for seamless theme switching with system preference detection. Custom CSS variables ensure consistent theming across all components with WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum) for accessibility compliance.

## Color Palette & Design Decisions

Ultra-modern professional design with precise WCAG AA contrast ratios. Custom color tokens ensure 4.5:1 minimum contrast in both modes.

Three-layer parallax, typed text effects, and interactive timelines establish visual sophistication while maintaining accessibility standards.
